# International Space Station Location Web Application

This project fetches the real-time location of the International Space Station using the Open Notify API and displays its latitude, longitude, and the converted readable date and time.

## Project Overview
The application provides a simple interface that fetches the current location of the International Space Station through an API call and displays the coordinates and the corresponding converted date and time of its position.

**Note:** For detailed implementation steps, refer to the completed Example 2 folder provided in the 'examples' directory.

## Features
- **Location Retrieval:** Fetches the current latitude and longitude of the International Space Station from the Open Notify API.
- **UNIX Timestamp Conversion:** Converts the UNIX timestamp received from the API into a human-readable date and time format.
- **Web Display:** Renders the ISS location data and the converted date and time on a website.

## Project Implementation
The completed 'fetch-example.js' file, containing all necessary steps for data retrieval and conversion, has been placed in the 'Example 2' folder, which has been updated with the required changes. This folder has been transferred back to Dropbox.

**Note:** The specific implementation steps and code snippets for this process reside in the local development environment and may not be displayed here.

## Usage
To use this application, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the 'Example 2' directory to your local machine from Dropbox.
2. Open 'fetch-example.js' and execute the necessary steps outlined in the comments within the file.
3. Host the HTML file to visualize the live location and the converted date and time of the ISS.

## Additional Information
The website showcases the current location of the International Space Station, providing both geographic coordinates and a human-readable timestamp.

**Note:** Due to privacy concerns, specific code and API keys have been omitted from this documentation.
